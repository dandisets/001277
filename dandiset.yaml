description: Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode array with an inter-electrode
  spacing of 10 mm. The electrode array was positioned at the bottom of the well plate
  (0 mm). Pulse durations of 300 ns, 600 ns, and 900 ns were tested. Depending on
  the pulse duration, the protocol consisted of 18 packets for 300 ns pulses, 9 packets
  for 600 ns pulses, or 6 packets for 900 ns pulses, delivered at frequencies of 0.4
  MHz, 0.2 MHz, and 0.14 MHz, respectively. Each protocol was repeated twice at a
  frequency of 1 Hz. Cell monolayer integrity was assessed using Hoechst staining,
  while membrane permeability was evaluated with YoPro-1. This work was partially
  supported by NIH grant 1R21EY034258.
