Protocol repeated 2 time(s) at 1Hz frequency.. ***General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent)*** Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 300/600/900 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 300/600/900 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. The number of protocol repetitions, pulse duration, and protocol type applied are noted under the Subject-Specific description.Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained all cell nuclei. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and YP uptake, serving as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, was visualized via the FITC channel.

"***Subject-Specific Description*** Subject ID: P1_20240926_A2. Fluorescent Channel(s) used: Cy3-DAPI.Image taken 2 hours after pulse exposure. Protocol: CanCan (with canceling pulses).. Pulse duration - 300 ns. Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency. Protocol repeated 2 time(s) at 1Hz frequency.. ***General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent)*** Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 300/600/900 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 300/600/900 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. The number of protocol repetitions, pulse duration, and protocol type applied are noted under the Subject-Specific description.Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained all cell nuclei. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and YP uptake, serving as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, was visualized via the FITC channel. For some experiments (indicated by the Cy3 channel), cell death was evaluated using propidium iodide staining two hours after exposure. More details about the methods are available in the related manuscript.",

Subsequently, simultaneous pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. The number of protocol repetitions, pulse duration, and protocol type applied are noted under the Subject-Specific description.Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained all cell nuclei. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and YP uptake, serving as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, was visualized via the FITC channel. For some experiments (indicated by the Cy3 channel), cell death was evaluated using propidium iodide staining two hours after exposure.

Protocol repeated 2 time(s) at 1Hz frequency.. ***General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent)*** Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 300/600/900 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 300/600/900 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. The number of protocol repetitions, pulse duration, and protocol type applied are noted under the Subject-Specific description.Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP).

The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 300/600/900 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 300/600/900 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1.

These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. The number of protocol repetitions, pulse duration, and protocol type applied are noted under the Subject-Specific description.Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP).

"***Subject-Specific Description*** Subject ID: P2_20240925_A2. Fluorescent Channel(s) used: DAPI.Image taken before pulse exposure. Protocol: CanCan (with canceling pulses).. Pulse duration - 900 ns. Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency. Protocol repeated 2 time(s) at 1Hz frequency.. ***General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent)*** Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 300/600/900 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 300/600/900 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode.

Protocol repeated 2 time(s) at 1Hz frequency.. ***General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent)*** Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 300/600/900 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 300/600/900 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. The number of protocol repetitions, pulse duration, and protocol type applied are noted under the Subject-Specific description.Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained all cell nuclei. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and YP uptake, serving as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, was visualized via the FITC channel. For some experiments (indicated by the Cy3 channel), cell death was evaluated using propidium iodide staining two hours after exposure.

"***Subject-Specific Description*** Subject ID: P2_20240925_B3. Fluorescent Channel(s) used: FITC.Image taken 30min after pulse exposure. Protocol: CanCan (with canceling pulses).. Pulse duration - 300 ns. Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency. Protocol repeated 2 time(s) at 1Hz frequency.. ***General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent)*** Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 300/600/900 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 300/600/900 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. The number of protocol repetitions, pulse duration, and protocol type applied are noted under the Subject-Specific description.Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained all cell nuclei. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and YP uptake, serving as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, was visualized via the FITC channel. For some experiments (indicated by the Cy3 channel), cell death was evaluated using propidium iodide staining two hours after exposure. More details about the methods are available in the related manuscript.",
